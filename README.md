# TravelTide-Session-Abandonment

## Overview
e-booking startup TravelTide is a hot new player in the online travel industry. The TravelTide team has recently shifted focus from aggressively acquiring new customers to better serving their existing customers. In order to achieve better service, the team recognizes they need to understand their customers better.

In particular, the TravelTide team is curious about session abandonment. The definition of session abandonment is “a browsing session that does not result in booked flight or hotel”.

## Task
The task is to help the TravelTide team develop an understanding of session abandonment. We are provided with a list of questions, a database connection, and a data dictionary.
